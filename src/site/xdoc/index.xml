                    This plugin allows to manage authentication on the Lutece site. 
                    It must be associated with a specific authentication module 
                    corresponding to the chosen system: Database, LDAP, OAuth, CAS ...    
                </p>
                <p>
                Attributes can be associated with the user. 
                </p>
                <p>
                During authentication, some attributes can be set by the authenticator.
                </p>
                <p>
		It is possible to configure external attribute providers that will provide attribute values for the user after authentication.
		</p>
                <p>
		It is also possible to configure role providers making it possible to assign a role (front office role) to the connected user 
		(a default role provider class is available to associate a single default role after authentication, configured in the datastore ).
